# Post Launch TODOs

Possible future additions/changes.

- Labels for ability description and IV/EV stats in Pokemon summary screen.
- Pokedex to support regional variants.
- Pokedex to have other data as well. Moves, base stats, evolution requirements, abilities?
- Improve various art assets, mostly trainer pics.
- The berry trees of the type resist berries should have their own colours.
- Implement Zinnia's battle theme. Song is in game data, but not playing well. May be that I haven't figured out the right voicegroup or the song I chose isn't viable to use with GBA sound. Violin sound samples have been added as well just for this song.
- Implement the multi-ability pop-up box in battles. The code is there, I just can't configure it right.
- A contest side-quest with Lisia, much like in ORAS.
- Perhaps a more interesting Tate & Liza event to get Jirachi?
- Scott giving more interesting rewards to players who get all silver/gold symbols.
- In-game resource that teaches the player braile. So that it isn't required to look out of the game to solve the braile puzzles.
- Sort out the online/wireless features. Either find out how to make them work or remove them.
- Better Game Corner games. May be a ton of work though. (Perhaps one could be a Battle Palace style battle where the Player places a bet?)
- Better Battle Frontier level scaling. Open level puts opponent Pokemon to your highest level Pokemon. Should scale all Pokemon to a certain level like the battle facilities in future gens.
- Add an Anything Goes challenge to the Battle Tower, where even legendary Pokemon like Rayquaza are allowed.
- Make Origin moves use their own PP. PP reduction is done in Battle Script Commands and I currently can't think of a way to differentiate Origin moves and normal moves in `Cmd_ppreduce`. Origin moves not using their own PP is currently a "feature" until this problem can be solved.
- Increase number of PC Pokemon storage boxes (annoying to do late in development since changing the save data format will invalid previous save data).
- Add another star to the Trainer Card for completing the National Dex. Create a platinum colour scheme to go along with it.
- Named NPCs like Gym Leaders, Elite 4, Steven, etc to be possible partners in Battle Tower Multi challenge.
- A better way for Mirage Island to trigger?
- Obligatory beach episode.

# Known Bugs

Some of these may have been carried over from pokeemerald-expansion.

- Many switch-in abilities (like Frisk and Imposter) don‚Äôt activate when both Player Pokemon and opponent Pokemon fainted previous turn (e.g. Destiny Bond) and the Player sends out a Pokemon before the opponent sends out theirs. Solving this will probably involve having to rewrite the code that deals with switch-in abilities. This is probably the same behavior as in vanilla Pokemon Emerald, but I don't see why Trace and Intimidate are allowed to activate whilst others don't, so I'm considering this a bug.
- Abilities that activate at the same time as other abilities on the same Pokemon can have their names in the ability pop-up overwritten. (e.g. Tyranitar with Sand Stream and Unnerve). This is due to how switch-in (and other types) abilities are handled. This could be fixed by setting gLastUsedAbility during the ability battle script with the new setlastusedability command, but this freezes the game when used before calling the ability pop-up. Why? Have no fucking clue.
- Abilities that activate at the same time as other abilities can use wrong strings in the battle message.
- When Rattled is activated, the wrong ability is shown on the pop-up.
- Sometimes when Truant triggers, the wrong ability is shown on the pop-up.
- Intimidate may trigger on fainted Pokemon.
- Frisk may trigger on the wrong Pokemon. Often occurs in Battle Frontier.
- Arena Trap battle message when trying to switch doesn't show the ability string.
- Damp battle message when it by powder move doesn't show the ability string.
- When a Pokemon with Volt Absorb uses Ion Deluge, it triggers Volt Absorb.
- Stench ability may activate for opponent and not user. Scenario: Weezing vs Altaria, Altaria (no King's Rock) used Ice Beam which flinched Weezing, could be a bad gBattlerAttacker assignment or similar.
- When a grass type uses Stun Spore against an opponent with Magic Bounce, it bounces back and paralyzes the grass type.
- Time Traveller ability ignores False Swipe effect of leaving the user with 1 HP.
- Bug Bite/Pluck is not taking the effects of the opponent's berry.
- Spinning Body activates on every hit for multi-hit moves (e.g. Hitmontop using Triple Kick). Would rather it takes affect on only the last hit.
- Backgrounds of some moves are glitched or have black boxes. (Shadow Bone, Gunk Shot, Hurricane, Focus Blast, Aura Sphere, Burn Up)
- Blaze Impact move fire effects are in the wrong place when used by opponent.
- Cloud reflection can be seen in the long grass in Route 120.
- Jumping into long grass from ledge and moving produces incorrect grass animation.
- NPCs can change colour when picking items at BP exchange corner. Palette bug.
- Shop tiles change colour when in shop mode in Mauville sweet shop. Palette bug.
- In Contests of super rank and above, Pokemon sprites and NPC overworld sprites can get weird colours. Palette bug linked to too many NPCs on screen.
- When a Pokemon evolves by trading, an exp gain sound plays over the Pokemon's cry.
- When trading with the tradeback guy and you use a Pokemon with a different ID than your own (from in-game trade), the trade screen says you are trading with the Pokemon's previous owner.
- Wild Deoxys may not regenerate HP bar properly in battle. This is just visual, actual HP values are there. Repeatedly occurs when KOing it from 100% HP.
- Deoxys is also supposed to use a form change animation when changing forms, but it isn't working at all.
- Deoxys may also skip a form change. Repeatedly occurs with Draining Kiss.
- Origin move selection has a visual cursor bug when normal moves are selected, cursor selects 3rd or 4th move, return to main fight menu and then choose Origin move.
- Some Pokemon in PC boxes have the top left corner of their front sprite snipped off. (Dodrio, Alakazam, Kyogre, Lanturn, Aerodactyl, Flygon, Salamence and more)
- Move relearner doesn't list all of the possible moves to relearn, only the first ~15.
- HP bar in battle may look weird, starting with a ?. When hit it may start subtracting at over a thousand health and looks like it drops down to 100% health. Visual error, looks like a full HP bar but not.
